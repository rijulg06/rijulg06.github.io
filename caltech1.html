        <p class="margin">At this internship, my partner and I worked with <a href="https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/lulu-qian" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Professor Lulu Qian</a> as well as her PhD students and postdocs in the field of DNA nanotechnology to improve the performance of a supervised learning DNA-based winner-take-all neural network, the subject of a postdoc’s thesis chapter.</p>
        <p class="margin">Over the course of three months, we learned the basics of DNA nanotechnology, programmable biochemical systems capable of making decisions, and the implementation of neural networks in DNA. My partner and I then noticed an issue that would cause the network to perform suboptimally when classifying patterns. We used Python, NUPACK, Mathematica, and Wolfram as well as various experiments to find and test a working solution to this issue, then presented and reported our findings.</p>

          <h2>How does this even work?</h2>
          <p>Similar to computers, biological organisms are able to perform designated functions. The difference is in how the information is encoded. In a computer program, information encoded in silicon dictates how the program should perform a task. In a molecular program, on the other hand, information encoded in molecules (in our case, DNA) dictates how organisms should perform a task. During this project, my partner and I worked on a supervised learning neural network that was implemented using DNA strands. Similar to neural networks in computer science, this system contained weights that allowed the network to classify molecules.</p>

        <div class="tab">
          <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
          <p>My partner and I noticed that a smaller than expected concentration of weight for certain bits was being activated. This means that those bits would not be assigned the proper level of importance. With these slight errors accumulating, this could lead to decreased accuracy for the network, or even a misclassification of molecules.</p>

        <label for="s1">Identifying Cause</label>
        <div class="tab">
          <h2>What was causing this to happen?</h2>
          <p>The toeholds of problematic bits’ activators were being occluded due to the formation of a hairpin. This meant less activator, and thus, less weight was activated. After analyzing NUPACK binding matrices for all 100 bits, we delineated the bits into three categories (“good,” “in between,” and “bad”) based on the level of hairpin formation. We then ran a gel electrophoresis experiment, which confirmed our conclusion.</p>

        <input type="radio" id="s2" name="mytabs">
        <label for="s2">Proposed Solution</label>
        <div class="tab">
          <h2>How could we fix the issue?</h2>
          <p>Based on the patterns we noticed with the “bad” bits, my partner and I changed the sequences of these bits to avoid hairpin formation. Using NUPACK, we selected the best sequence that changed the least amount of nucleotide bases. We then tested the new sequences compared to the old in a wet lab experiment to confirm the NUPACK analysis.</p>

        <input type="radio" id="t2" name="mytabs">
        <label for="t2">Wet Lab</label>
        <div class="tab">
          <h2>What was our wet lab procedure?</h2>
          <p>After ordering the DNA strands from IDT, we used a Nanodrop to determine the concentrations. We then annealed and diluted the strands, which we then used for the training and testing phases of the supervised learning network.</p>
        </div>
        <input type="radio" id="results" name="mytabs">
        <label for="results">Results</label>
        <div class="tab">
          <h2>What did our wet lab tell us?</h2>
          <p>Compared to the old sequences, the new sequences reached a much more accurate activation. Directly corresponding with our NUPACK analysis, we saw that the two problematic bits we chose improved by over 30% and 60%. The former reached levels comparable to the positive control (“good” bit) that we chose. Based on our observations, we were able to redesign all sequences using Python, therefore effectively solving a notable issue within this neural network.</p>
